Linear Programming – Production Optimization

Problem: Maximize Factory Profit

A factory produces two products: A and B.

Profit:

Product A → $40 per unit

Product B → $30 per unit

Constraints:

Each unit of A requires 2 hours of labor

Each unit of B requires 1 hour of labor

Total available labor = 100 hours

A ≤ 40 units (market demand limit)

Step 1: Define Variables

Let:

x = units of Product A

y = units of Product B

Step 2: Objective Function

Maximize profit: 𝑍 = 40𝑥 + 30𝑦

Step 3: Constraints

Labor constraint: 2𝑥 + 𝑦 ≤ 100

Demand constraint: 𝑥 ≤ 40

Non-negativity: 𝑥 ≥ 0, 𝑦 ≥ 0

Step 4: Solve Using Corner Point Method

From labor constraint:

If x = 0 → y = 100

If x = 40 →


2(40)+y=100

80 + y = 100

𝑦 = 20

Evaluate objective function:

At (0,100): 

Z = 30(100) = 3000

At (40,20): 

Z = 40(40) + 30(20)

Z = 1600 + 600 = 2200

Optimal Solution

Maximum profit occurs at:

(x,y)=(0,100)

𝑍 = 3000
